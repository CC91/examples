<h1><center>Tutorial Introduction to Guile</center></h1>

<p>This is a tutorial introduction to using Guile, the GNU extension
language.  I'm aiming at people who want to <i>use</i> Guile, and who
<i>don't</i> want to mess around in the guts of Guile itself.</p>

<p>For example, if you've just written a spiffy new word
processor/image manipulator/window manager, and you want your users to
be able to run cunning scripts, then Guile is the library for you and
(hopefully) this is the tutorial for you.</p>

<p>I'm going to assume that you know a little bit about the Scheme
programming language, and I'm also going to assume that you have
managed to get Guile successfully built and installed on your
system. I'm also going to assume that you have Guile version 1.3
or higher.</p>

<a name="fund"><h2>The Fundamentals</h2></a>

<a name="fund.theory"><h3>Theory</h3></a>

<p>Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language, made
available as a library, together with conventions for interfacing to
the interpreter from other programming languages. </p>

<p>The point of this is to allow <i>extensibility</i>.  You can write
a big piece of software in C, and then allow the users of your
software to write Scheme scripts which call various C functions in
your software.  I'll show a simple example of this later on.</p>

<p>That's not all.  One of the things that Scheme as a programming
language is particularly good at is the emulation of other programming
languages.  This means that your users don't actually have to write
their extension scripts in Scheme; instead, they can write the scripts
in Tcl or Python, and just load up the appropriate chunk of Scheme
code to emulate that language. (Or at least they will be able to, when
the appropriate translators have been written.)</p>

<a name="fund.practice"><h3>Practice</h3></a>

<p>In concrete terms, you'll have a number of things available once
you have Guile correctly installed.</p>

<p>Firstly, you should have <code>guile</code>, which is the Guile
Scheme interpreter as a stand-alone executable.  This is useful if you
want to just write Scheme code; it's also useful for testing out bits
of extension Scheme code interactively.  This should be very small,
since all it contains is a thin wrapper for the Guile shared library
(on my system, it's less than 4k).</p>

<p>Secondly and most importantly, you should have
<code>libguile.so</code>.  This is the Guile shared library, which you
can link to from your C (or C++ or whatever) code.</p>

<p>Thirdly, you'll probably also have some standard Scheme library
functions installed somewhere.  These will typically have a
<code>.scm</code> filename extension; on my (RedHat 6.0 Linux) system
these are installed under <code>/usr/share/guile</code>.

<p>The things I've described so far make up the primary parts of
Guile, that is the things you'll need if you want to run a program
which uses Guile as its extension language. (In RedHat
package terms, these are all in the <code>guile</code> package).</p>

<p>Given that we want to write code, we need a few more things (which
are kept in the <code>guile-devel</code> RedHat package). . . .</p>

<p>Fourth is a collection of header files which cover the process of
calling Guile from C and vice-versa.  These might get installed into
<code>/usr/include/guile</code> and <code>/usr/include/libguile</code>,
for example.</p>

<p>Fifth is the utility function <code>guile-snarf</code>.  This
utility is used to ease the process of getting Guile and C to talk to
one another, provided you stick to some coding conventions. </p>

<p>Sixth and last is the utility <code>guile-config</code>.
This program scans your local configuration and tells you what options
you need to compile and link Guile code into your programs.</p>

<hr>
<a name="tortoise"><h2>The Tortoise</h2></a>

<p><i><center>"Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?" Alice
asked. </center>
<center>"We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock Turtle
angrily.</center></i>
<center>Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass</center></p>


<p>To demonstrate Guile, we are going to write a very simple graphics
program.  It's written for the X Window system; however, it is so
simple it should be easy to convert to other graphics systems.</p>

<p>The program draws graphics by assuming that there is a tortoise
sitting in the middle of the screen.  This tortoise is quite stupid,
and can only understand a small number of instructions.</p>

<p>You can ask the tortoise to turn to the right by a number of degrees
(negative numbers will get him to turn to the left).  You can ask the
tortoise to walk forward a certain number of steps.  And you can ask
him to hold a pen either in his paws or behind his ear, so that when
he moves he will either leave a mark on the ground or not
(respectively).</p>

<p>Finally, in case the tortoise gets utterly confused, you can ask
the tortoise to return to the middle of the screen and turn to face
the top of the screen again</p>

<a name="tortoise.core"><h3>The Core Program</h3></a>

<p>To program this up, I'm going to write a C program where each of
the tortoise instructions corresponds to a function call.</p>

<p>First, lets take care of the bookkeeping.  The <code>main()</code>
function will deal with the mechanics of getting some graphics -
getting a window and a GC, in X terms.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h>
#define WINDOW_SIZE 500
Display *theDisplay;
Window theWindow;
Screen *theScreen;
GC theGC;
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    theDisplay = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
    XSynchronize(theDisplay, True);
    theScreen = DefaultScreenOfDisplay(theDisplay);
    theWindow = XCreateSimpleWindow(theDisplay, RootWindowOfScreen(theScreen),
                                    0, 0,
                                    WINDOW_SIZE, WINDOW_SIZE, 0,
                                    BlackPixelOfScreen(theScreen),
                                    WhitePixelOfScreen(theScreen));
    theGC = XCreateGC(theDisplay, theWindow, 0L, NULL);
    XSetForeground(theDisplay, theGC, BlackPixelOfScreen(theScreen));
    XMapWindow(theDisplay,theWindow);
    /* more stuff to come here . . */
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Next, we have some variables which hold the current state of the
tortoise:</p>
<pre>
double currentX;
double currentY;
double currentDirection;
int penDown;
</pre>

<p>We need to initialize this data, so we add the following function
invocation to <code>main()</code>:</p>

<pre>
    tortoise_reset();
</pre>

<p>The function being invoked here implements one of the things that
the tortoise can do.  There are similar functions which implement all
of the other things that the tortoise can do:</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;math.h>
#define DEGREES_TO_RADIANS  (3.1415926535897932384626433832795029L/180.0)

void tortoise_reset()
{
    currentX = currentY = WINDOW_SIZE/2;
    currentDirection = 0.0;
    penDown = 1;
}
void tortoise_pendown()
{
    penDown = 1;
}
void tortoise_penup()
{
    penDown = 0;
}
void tortoise_turn(int degrees)
{
    currentDirection += (double)degrees;
}
void tortoise_move(int steps)
{
    double newX, newY;
    /* first work out the new endpoint */
    newX = currentX + sin(currentDirection*DEGREES_TO_RADIANS)*(double)steps;
    newY = currentY - cos(currentDirection*DEGREES_TO_RADIANS)*(double)steps;
    /* if the pen is down, draw a line */
    if (penDown) XDrawLine(theDisplay, theWindow, theGC,
                           (int)currentX, (int)currentY, (int)newX, (int)newY);
    /* in either case, move the tortoise */
    currentX = newX;
    currentY = newY;
}
</pre>

<a name="tortoise.test"><h3>Testing it Out</h3></a>

<p>We can test that we have written our primitives correctly by
temporarily including some test code at the end of <code>main()</code>:</p>

<pre>
    {
        int ii;
        tortoise_pendown();
        for (ii=0; ii&lt;4; ii++) {
            tortoise_move(100);
            tortoise_turn(90.0);
        }
        /* sleep for a bit so the window stays visible */
        sleep(10);
    }
</pre>

<p>As expected, <a href="tortoise1.html">this</a>
draws a square in the window. (Compilation instructions
<a href="compilation.html">here</a>)</p>

<img src="square.jpg" border=2 width=199 height=215
alt="Square drawn by test code">

<p>That's it.  We have all the code we need. Except, of course, that
we have no way to get our tortoise to <i>do</i> anything. Now we want
to let the user instruct the tortoise directly.</p>

<hr>
<a name="beguile"><h2>Becoming BeGuiled</h2></a>

<a name="beguile.talk"><h3>Talking to the Tortoise</h3></a>

<p>This is where Guile comes into play.  Without Guile, we would
have to write code to read input from the user, interpret it, and call
the appropriate tortoise primitive.</p>

<p>Even if we did write this code, the user would only be able to
instruct the tortoise directly.  There would be no way for the user to
perform loops or iterations; they would just have to do a lot of
typing.</p>

<p>In fact, in order to get more programmable function out of the
tortoise we would need to write an interpreter for a tortoise
programming language.</p>

<p>This would be wasted effort; Guile already provides a perfectly good way
of making our tortoise programmable.  The next section talks about how
to do this.</p>



<a name="beguile.avail"><h3>Making Guile available from the program</h3></a>

<p>The first step is to get access to the Guile library from within the
program.  To do this, we first need to include the master header file:</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;guile/gh.h>
</pre>

<p>You may need to add an extra include directory to your path to get
at this header file; the command <code>guile-config compile</code>
should tell you where to find it.</p>

<p>Next, we need to kick off the Guile interpreter. This is done in
two steps; firstly, for arcane reasons we need to call
<code>gh_enter</code> at the end of <code>main()</code>.</p>

<pre>
    gh_enter(argc, argv, inner_main);
    return(0); /* never reached */
</pre>

<p>Secondly, <code>gh_enter</code> will call back into the
<code>inner_main</code> function passed to it, and it is this
<code>inner_main</code> function which actually calls
<code>gh_repl</code> to start the Scheme interpreter
(the <code>repl</code> stands for Read-Evaluate-Print Loop, in case you
were interested).

<pre>
void inner_main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    register_procs();
    gh_repl(argc, argv);
}
</pre>

<p>This code refers to the function <code>register_procs</code>.  We'll
come to this below</p>

<p>Finally, we need to link with the <code>libguile.so</code> library.
On my system, this simply involved adding <code>-lguile</code> to the
link line.  Running <code>guile-config link</code> is a good way of
finding out what you might need to do on your system.</p>

<a name="beguile.primitives"><h3>Making the Primitives available from Guile</h3></a>

<p>At this point, we now have our tortoise program invoking the Guile
interpreter, but the user has no way of accessing all of our tortoise
functionality. When the program starts, the user can interactively
write programs in Scheme, but can't get the tortoise to wake up and do
anything.</p>

<p>What we need to do is to make all of our tortoise primitives
available from the Scheme interpreter.</p>

<p>To recap, these were:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>tortoise_reset()</code> to return the tortoise to the
  starting position</li>
  <li><code>tortoise_pendown()</code> to lower the pen</li>
  <li><code>tortoise_penup()</code> to raise the pen</li>
  <li><code>tortoise_turn(int degrees)</code> to turn
  <code>degrees</code> clockwise</li>
  <li><code>tortoise_move(int steps)</code> to move <code>steps</code>
  steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>We make Scheme accessible versions of all of these.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;math.h>
#define DEGREES_TO_RADIANS  (3.1415926535897932384626433832795029L/180.0)

SCM tortoise_reset()
{
    currentX = currentY = WINDOW_SIZE/2;
    currentDirection = 0;
    penDown = 1;
    return SCM_EOL;
}
SCM tortoise_pendown()
{
    penDown = 1;
    return SCM_EOL;
}
SCM tortoise_penup()
{
    penDown = 0;
    return SCM_EOL;
}
SCM tortoise_turn(SCM s_degrees)
{
    int degrees = SCM_INUM(s_degrees);
    currentDirection += (double)degrees;
    return SCM_EOL;
}
SCM tortoise_move(SCM s_steps)
{
    double newX, newY;
    int steps = SCM_INUM(s_steps);
    /* first work out the new endpoint */
    newX = currentX + sin(currentDirection*DEGREES_TO_RADIANS)*(double)steps;
    newY = currentY - cos(currentDirection*DEGREES_TO_RADIANS)*(double)steps;
    /* if the pen is down, draw a line */
    if (penDown) XDrawLine(theDisplay, theWindow, theGC,
                           (int)currentX, (int)currentY, (int)newX, (int)newY);
    /* in either case, move the tortoise */
    currentX = newX;
    currentY = newY;
    return SCM_EOL;
}
</pre>

<p>In this code, there are a few key points</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each of the new versions of these functions returns something of
  type <code>SCM</code>, which is the universal type
  for representing Scheme values inside C code.  For now, in all of these
  functions we return the specific value <code>SCM_EOL</code>, which
  is the way to say the Scheme value <code>()</code> in C.</li>
  <li>The first three functions all take no arguments; however, the
  last two functions each require a single argument.  The value of
  this argument is going to be provided by the Scheme interpreter, and
  so it appears as an <code>SCM</code> type once more</li>
  <li>The macro <code>SCM_INUM</code> converts a Scheme object into a
  regular C integer, on the assumption that the object <i>is</i>
  actually an integer. (If it isn't, what happens is undefined)</li>
</ul>

<p>Having set up all of these C functions in a way which is accessible
from Guile, we now need to tell Guile that they are there.  To do
this, we define the function <code>register_procs</code> which was
mentioned in the previous section.</p>

<pre>
void register_procs(void)
{
    gh_new_procedure("tortoise-reset",   tortoise_reset,   0, 0, 0);
    gh_new_procedure("tortoise-pendown", tortoise_pendown, 0, 0, 0);
    gh_new_procedure("tortoise-penup",   tortoise_penup,   0, 0, 0);
    gh_new_procedure("tortoise-turn",    tortoise_turn,    1, 0, 0);
    gh_new_procedure("tortoise-move",    tortoise_move,    1, 0, 0);
}
</pre>

<p>The registration of the new Guile-accessible primitives is done by
the calls to <code>gh_new_procedure</code>.  This function takes the
following parameters</p>
<ol>
  <li>A string giving the name of the function when seen from
  Guile.</li>
  <li>The C function providing the primitive</li>
  <li>The number of required arguments to the function (0 or 1 in all
  our examples).</li>
  <li>The number of optional arguments to the function (0 in all our
  examples).</li>
  <li>A boolean expression indicating whether the function takes a
  'rest' list (false in all our examples)</li>
</ol>

<a name="beguile.run"><h3>Running It</h3></a>
<p>Amazingly, that's it - we have the <a href="tortoise2.html">
entire program</a>.  If we now compile and run the program, we get a
Guile interpreter prompt:</p>
<code>guile> </code>
<p>We can now try a few commands:</p>
<pre>
guile> <b>(tortoise-move 100)</b>
()
guile> <b>(tortoise-turn 90)</b>
()
guile> <b>(tortoise-move 100)</b>
()
</pre>
<p>At this point, a couple of lines should have appeared in the
program's window.</p>

<img src="ell.jpg" border=2 width=217 height=201
alt="First lines drawn by the user">

<p>Given that this is Scheme, we can define a new top-level procedure.</p>
<pre>
guile> <b>(define (move-n-turn angle) </b>
...    <b>        (tortoise-move 100) (tortoise-turn angle))</b>
guile> <b>(for-each move-n-turn '(80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80))</b>

<hr>
<a name="nextsteps"><h2>Next Steps</h2></a>
<a name="nextsteps.more"><h3>More Communication Between Scheme and C</h3></a>

<p>All of the primitives so far have returned the empty list, because
this was easy to do.  However, we'd now like to pass some information
back from C to Scheme - in particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>tortoise-turn</code> should return the angle that the
  tortoise was at before this turn took effect</li>
  <li><code>tortoise-penup</code> and <code>tortoise-pendown</code>
  should both return the whether the pen was down before the call</li>
  <li><code>tortoise-move</code> should return the previous position
  of the turtle as a Scheme list, for example <code>(200 200)</code>
</ul>

<p>Also, we've noticed that <code>tortoise-move</code> and
<code>tortoise-turn</code> only allow an integer argument.  It's time
to change this so that we can specify floating point values for these
arguments.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;math.h>
#define DEGREES_TO_RADIANS  (3.1415926535897932384626433832795029L/180.0)

SCM tortoise_reset()
{
    currentX = currentY = WINDOW_SIZE/2;
    currentDirection = 0;
    penDown = 1;
    return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
}
SCM tortoise_pendown()
{
    int prevValue = penDown;
    penDown = 1;
    return (prevValue ? SCM_BOOL_T: SCM_BOOL_F);
}
SCM tortoise_penup()
{
    int prevValue = penDown;
    penDown = 0;
    return (prevValue ? SCM_BOOL_T: SCM_BOOL_F);
}
SCM tortoise_turn(SCM s_degrees)
{
    int prevValue = (int)currentDirection;
    double degrees;
    SCM_ASSERT(SCM_NUMBERP(s_degrees), s_degrees, SCM_ARG1, "tortoise-turn");
    degrees = SCM_NUM2DBL(s_degrees);
    currentDirection += degrees;
    return SCM_MAKINUM(prevValue);
}
SCM tortoise_move(SCM s_steps)
{
    double oldX = currentX;
    double oldY = currentY;
    double newX, newY;
    double steps;
    SCM_ASSERT(SCM_NUMBERP(s_steps), s_steps, SCM_ARG1, "tortoise-move");
    steps = SCM_NUM2DBL(s_steps);
    /* first work out the new endpoint */
    newX = currentX + sin(currentDirection*DEGREES_TO_RADIANS)*steps;
    newY = currentY - cos(currentDirection*DEGREES_TO_RADIANS)*steps;
    /* if the pen is down, draw a line */
    if (penDown) XDrawLine(theDisplay, theWindow, theGC,
                           (int)currentX, (int)currentY, (int)newX, (int)newY);
    /* in either case, move the tortoise */
    currentX = newX;
    currentY = newY;
    return gh_cons(gh_double2scm(oldX) , gh_cons(gh_double2scm(oldY), SCM_EOL));
}
</pre>

<p>So what's different about this version of the code? Well, firstly
the pen up/down functions use <code>SCM_BOOL_F</code> and
<code>SCM_BOOL_T</code> to return the Scheme values <code>#f</code>
and <code>#t</code>, as appropriate.  Secondly,
<code>tortoise_turn</code> uses <code>SCM_MAKINUM</code> to build a
Scheme integer from a C integer.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the function <code>tortoise-move</code> builds a list
containing the previous coordinates using</p>
<ul>
   <li><code>gh_double2scm</code>, which converts a C
   <code>double</code> to the equivalent Scheme value, and</li>
   <li><code>gh_cons</code>, which conses two C representations
   (<code>SCM</code>s) of Scheme values together.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fourthly, <code>tortoise_move</code> and <code>tortoise_turn</code>
use <code>SCM_NUM2DBL</code> instead
of <code>SCM_INUM</code> to get a floating point value from their single
arguments.</p>

<p>Finally, I mentioned before that the results of <code>SCM_INUM</code> are
undefined if the Scheme value passed in is not an integer.  The same
is true for <code>SCM_NUM2DBL</code> if the Scheme value passed in is
not some sort of number.  However, in this version of the
code I protect against this possibility.</p>

<p>The way to ensure that an argument passed from Scheme to C is of a
particular type is to use <code>SCM_ASSERT</code>, combined with a
test for the required type such as <code>SCM_NUMBERP</code> or
<code>SCM_INUMP</code>.  The arguments to <code>SCM_ASSERT</code>
are:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The test to perform.  If this returns 0, then an error is
  signalled to the user.</li>
  <li> The <code>SCM</code> object which caused the error, in this case the argument to
  the C function.</li>
  <li> A number indicating which position the erroneous argument was
  in.  In this case, the functions only have one argument, so we use
  the macro <code>SCM_ARG1</code>.</li>
  <li> The name of the function (as seen from Scheme) which raised the error.</li>
</ol>


<p>We can take advantage of these changes (<a href="tortoise3.html">this version of
the complete program</a>):</p>

<a name="nextsteps.scripts"><h3>Scripting</h3></a>

<p>In the examples so far, the program has kicked off the Guile Scheme
interpreter, allowing the user to interact with the program
dynamically.  For many of the potential uses of Guile, this is not
what is needed; the program will only need to read in a configuration
script at start-of-day, and then proceed with its normal
processing</p>

<p>So we're now going to change the program so that it reads in and
runs a <code>.tortoise</code> file at start-of-day. To do this, we
still need to use <code>gh_enter</code> to get to our
<code>inner_main</code> function.  However, when we get there, we
don't want to hand over control of the program to Guile with
<code>gh_repl</code>.</p>

<p>Instead, we want to open the <code>.tortoise</code> file and
explicitly pass the lines from it to the Scheme interpreter, one by
one.  When we're done with the file, we're done with the interpreter
and we can get on with the main business of the program.</p>

<pre>
#define CONFIGFILENAME          ".tortoise"
#define DIRECTORYSEPARATOR      "/"
void read_config_file(void)
{
    char *homedir;
    char *filename;
    FILE *file;
    char inputLine[1024];  /* hack: assume each line less than 1024 chars */
    char *p;
    /* open $HOME/.tortoise */
    homedir = getenv("HOME");
    if (homedir == NULL) return;
    filename = (char *)malloc(strlen(homedir) + strlen(CONFIGFILENAME) +
                              strlen(DIRECTORYSEPARATOR) + 1);
    if (filename == NULL) return;
    sprintf(filename, "%s%s%s", homedir, DIRECTORYSEPARATOR, CONFIGFILENAME);
    file = fopen(filename, "r");
    free(filename);
    if (file == NULL) return;
    /* spin through the file */
    while (1) {
        p = fgets(inputLine, sizeof(inputLine), file);
        if (p == NULL) return;
        gh_eval_str(p);
    }
    fclose(file);
}
void inner_main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    register_procs();
    read_config_file();
    /* now get on with the main business of the program . . . */
    sleep(20);
}
</pre>

<p>Here, the key function is <code>gh_eval_str</code>, which gets the
Scheme interpreter to evaluate one particular string and then
return. (The complete program is <a href="tortoise4.html"> here</a>)</p>

<p>We can test this out with a sample <code>.tortoise</code> file,
which defines a Scheme procedure for drawing a polygon with a given
number of sides:</p>

<pre>
(define (move-n-turn angle) (tortoise-move 100) (tortoise-turn angle))
(define (polygon n) (do ((i n (- i 1))) ((zero? i)) (move-n-turn (/ 360 n))))
(polygon 7)
</pre>

alt="Heptagon drawn by the .tortoise file">

<p>Unfortunately, there is a downside to this approach.  Each line of
our <code>.tortoise</code> file has to be a complete Scheme expression.</p>

<p>It's very easy to fix this - we just let Guile do more of the work
for us.  There is a function <code>gh_eval_file</code> which will load
an entire file and evaluate it:</p>
<pre>
#define CONFIGFILENAME          ".tortoise"
#define DIRECTORYSEPARATOR      "/"
void read_config_file(void)
{
    char *homedir;
    char *filename;
    /* build the $HOME/.tortoise filename */
    homedir = getenv("HOME");
    if (homedir == NULL) return;
    filename = (char *)malloc(strlen(homedir) + strlen(CONFIGFILENAME) +
                              strlen(DIRECTORYSEPARATOR) + 1);
    if (filename == NULL) return;
    sprintf(filename, "%s%s%s", homedir, DIRECTORYSEPARATOR, CONFIGFILENAME);
    /* get Guile to do all of the work */
    gh_eval_file(filename);
    free(filename);
}
void inner_main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    register_procs();
    read_config_file();
    /* now get on with the main business of the program . . . */
    gh_eval_str("(tortoise-turn 30)"); /* example: call C-defined procedure */
    gh_eval_str("(polygon 3)");   /* example: call Scheme-defined procedure */
    sleep(20);
}
</pre>

<p>With <a href="tortoise5.html">this version</a> of the code, we can re-write our
<code>.tortoise</code> file in a more easily readable version:</p>

<pre>
(define (move-n-turn angle)
  (tortoise-move 100)
  (tortoise-turn angle))
(define (polygon n)
  (do ((i n (- i 1)))
      ((zero? i))
    (move-n-turn (/ 360 n))))
(polygon 7)
</pre>

<a name="nextsteps.sofar"><h3>The Story So Far</h3></a>

<p>Let's recap on what we've seen so far.  We can now:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load up Guile from a C program, and get it to interpret user
  input from a file or interactively</li>
  <li>Make C functions available from Scheme with
  <code>gh_new_procedure</code></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Pass simple Scheme values to these C functions, extracting the
    values with <code>SCM_INUM</code> and
    <code>SCM_NUM2DBL</code></li>
    <li>Test that these Scheme values are of the expected type, using
    <code>SCM_ASSERT</code> and <code>SCM_NUMBERP</code></li>
    <li>Return simple and slightly more complicated Scheme values from these C
    functions using:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><code>SCM_EOL</code></li>
      <li><code>SCM_UNSPECIFIED</code></li>
      <li><code>SCM_BOOL_F</code> and <code>SCM_BOOL_T</code></li>
      <li><code>SCM_MAKINUM</code></li>
      <li><code>gh_double2scm</code></li>
      <li><code>gh_cons</code></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Make Scheme functions available from C, invoking them by
  evaluating a Scheme expression:
  <code>gh_eval_str("<i>(procname args)</i>")</code></li>
</ul>

<a name="nextsteps.read"><h3>Further Reading</h3></a>

<p>At this point, you probably need to find some more detailed
information on Guile.  Bizarrely, the official Guile documentation is
not currently available on the Guile homepage, so you'll either have
to scan the internet for <code>guile-doc</code>, or you'll have to get the
current <code>guile-doc</code> images via anonymous CVS (I couldn't do
this because my internet proxy won't allow it).</p>

<p>The Guile documentation includes a tutorial
(<code>guile-tut.info</code>), a reference manual
(<code>guile-ref.info*</code>) and a copy of the Revised^4 Report on
the Algorithmic Language Scheme (<code>r4rs.info*</code>).</p>

<p>Some things you might need to find out next:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to get the value of a Scheme variable from C (hint: use
  <code>gh_lookup</code>)</li>
  <li>How to prevent an incorrect <code>.tortoise</code> file from
  terminating your program (hint: use <code>gh_catch</code>)</li>
  <li>How to make Guile emulate other languages</li>
</ul>

<p>Have fun . . </p>

out how to do things.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this page will be useful to other people who are in the

<p>If you want to know the answers to deep tricky Guile questions, I'm
probably not the best person to ask.  Try joining one of the Guile
